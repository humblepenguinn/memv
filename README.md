## About

MEMV is a real-time memory visualization tool designed to help you understand C++ memory management concepts. As you write code, it displays the stack and heap in real-time, making it perfect for learning:

- **Pointers and references** - See how they work in memory
- **Stack vs Heap** - Visualize the difference between stack and heap allocation
- **Memory leaks** - Identify and understand memory leaks
- **Dangling pointers** - See what happens when pointers become invalid
- **Heap management** - Learn about allocation, deallocation, and memory management

> **Note:** MEMV currently supports only a small subset of the language, but it's powerful enough to learn many fundamental memory related concepts
